							<p class="question-contant__quest-sub">3.1 Prohibited Jurisdictions</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">By accessing and using FastEx, you acknowledge and declare that you are not located in, or a citizen or resident of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Crimea, Sudan, Syria, United States of America (including all USA territories like Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Island, and the US Virgin Islands (St. Croix, St. John and St. Thomas), Bangladesh and Bolivia, among with any other country subject to United Nations Security Council Sanctions List and its equivalent. FastEx maintains the right to select its markets and jurisdictions to operate in and may restrict or deny its services to certain countries. FastEx’s also maintains the right to use various methods to prevent the use of the Services by the users listed above. You are to comply with this Section, even if FastEx’s methods to prevent use of the Services are not effective or can be bypassed.</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">FastEx may seize any funds from Users in these jurisdictions and donate them to a charity at FastEx’s sole discretion. By accessing this site or any services therein, you represent and warrant that you are not physically located in these prohibited jurisdictions.</p>

							<p class="question-contant__quest">4. Prices, Exchange Rates, and Confirmations</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">Cryptocurrency and digital assets are highly experimental and risky. FastEx’s service attempts to provide accurate price and exchange rate information, but this information is highly volatile and can change quickly without users necessarily being aware of these changes. For normal orders, the exchange rate you receive is calculated at the time your payment is accepted. Due to varying security between blockchains, your payment is typically considered “accepted” at one block confirmation. FastEx may occasionally accept a payment with zero confirmations, though this decision is at FastEx’s sole discretion. It is important to note that a payment being broadcast to the blockchain network does not constitute an acceptance by FastEx of that payment.</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">Users who are sensitive to the exchange rate they receive should not use FastEx’s features. The User’s payment must be received by FastEx within that period in order to receive the guaranteed exchange rate. Please contact customer support (24/7) for more information on exchange rates.</p>

							<ol class="question-ol">
								<li class="question-ol__item">FastEx only accepts one deposit per TXID. If your funds are deposited in a TXID with more than one deposit, you will need to contact support to receive a refund. The exchange rate will not be honored and your exchange will not be completed.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">User deposits to FastEx that do not confirm within 48 hours of being detected will be cancelled. Refund requests (via Support Page) will be honored after the deposit is confirmed on the blockchain. The refunds will defer from the user’s original deposit amount due to the transaction fees.</li>
							</ol>

							<p class="question-contant__quest">5. Returns and Refund Policy</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">Cryptocurrencies, tokens, & all digital assets are, by their nature, generally irreversible, and their exchange rates are highly volatile and transitory. We cannot be responsible for any risk in use of the Website, including but not limited to exchange rate risk and market risk. All sales after an FastEx exchange are final.</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">You must submit a refund address for every transaction in the event that a refund is required in accordance with our Terms below. Failure to submit a refund address at the time of a transaction may result in your ineligibility to receive a refund.</p>

							<ol class="question-ol">
								<li class="question-ol__item">If an error occurs with a user’s exchange or interface on the user’s side of the transaction, the user must contact FastEx in order to solve the issues and arrange the potential refund.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">All transactions from FastEx.io to a user’s outgoing asset wallet shall be subject to all posted fees, including but not limited to miner fees. A full list of the miner fees is located on <a href="#">https://fastex.io/fees/</a>.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">Users have a maximum of 48 hours to reclaim any assets that are held in the FastEx system due to any error, whether by you or us. Refund requests submitted after the 48-hour period will not be refunded. Any decisions by FastEx with respect to refunds in these circumstances are final.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">Coins/tokens sent to the incorrect address (e.g., GNT sent to an ETH address) will be charged an Extraction Fee of 50 USD (in the equivalent of the mis-sent coin/token). The coin/token extraction process can take up to 20 business days. If a user wishes to expedite this process, additional charges may apply.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">Unsupported coins/tokens that are deposited into our system to unrelated wallets cannot be extracted or returned. FastEx reserves the right to handle this on a case–by-case basis. Any decisions by FastEx.io with respect to such coins or tokens being deposited when no longer supported are final.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">FastEx only accepts one deposit per transaction ID (TXID). If your funds are deposited in a TXID with more than one deposit, you will need to contact support to receive a refund. The exchange rate will not be honored and your exchange cannot be completed.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">Minimum deposit is 50 USD in equivalent currency. Transactions that do not meet these criteria will not be processed and will stay in FastEx’s balance until the above requirement is met.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">Deposits that were made without starting a transaction (users did not press the “Start Transaction” button) will be refunded with a 10 USD fee applied to them.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">Deposits under 5 USD are too small to be refunded due to the mining fee and administrative costs. FastEx shall not refund any coins or tokens that are worth less than 5 USD or equivalent value. Users are advised not to use the service for orders under this size. WARNING: There are fake websites pretending to be FastEx (aka “phishing scams”). They use a misspelled URL that looks like “FastEx.io” in order to trick users into sending them funds. DO NOT USE ANY SERVICE THAT ISN’T EXACTLY LOCATED AT THE DOMAIN: “FastEx.io”</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">FastEx is not responsible for funds that have been sent to these fake FastEx phishing sites. It is important that all users verify they are visiting the correct URL (FastEx.io) and search for the security certificate in the URL bar of their browser. Also, never trust private messages, solicitations, or requests for funds from people claiming to be FastEx unless you have verified that it is an official request from an FastEx.io operator. When in doubt, contact us directly to verify any messaging (24/7). Stay diligent – and please report any phishing scams to our team through our website: <a href="#">https://fastex.io/contact-us/</a>.</li>

							<p class="question-contant__quest">Crypto to Crypto AML/KYC</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">In our website users don’t need to create accounts: you don’t need to register or log in to use the Website. FastEx uses an automated risk management system to check all the transactions made by the Users. By accepting these Terms you agree to pass through the AML/KYC procedure, which may be applied to you or may be requested by FastEx in some cases. During the AML/KYC procedure, FastEx reserves the right to request additional information and documents, including but not limited to scan of your ID document valid in your country and additional information of the funds' origin. In limited cases (such as to verify your identity in order to pass the AML/KYC procedure or police investigation), we reserve the right to freeze your exchange transaction for any period of time necessary to complete the investigation and AML/KYC procedure. After a period of 30 days if you deny to pass through the AML/KYC procedure it is in our judgment what we will do with your funds. If you deny to pass through the AML/KYC procedure or don’t provide FastEx with the requested documents and information, FastEx has the right to refuse to execute your transactions (current and future). By accepting these Terms, you agree and warrant to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and take full responsibility for its accuracy, completeness and veracity.</p>

							<p class="question-contant__text">MoonPay Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer Policy (hereinafter - the “AML/KYC Policy”) is designated to prevent and mitigate possible risks of MoonPay being involved in any kind of illegal activity.</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">Both international and local regulations require MoonPay to implement effective internal procedures and mechanisms to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, drug and human trafficking, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, corruption and bribery and to take action in case of any form of suspicious activity from its Users.</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">AML/KYC Policy covers the following matters:</p>

							<ol class="question-ol">
								<li class="question-ol__item">Verification procedures.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">Compliance Officer.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">Monitoring transactions.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">Risk assessment.</li>
							</ol>

							<p class="question-contant__quest">Verification procedures</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">One of the international standards for preventing illegal activity is customer due diligence (“CDD”). According to CDD, MoonPay establishes its own verification procedures within the standards of anti-money laundering and “Know Your Customer” frameworks, including enhanced due diligence for customers presenting a higher risk, such as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs).</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">MoonPay’s identity verification procedure requires the User to provide MoonPay with reliable, independent source documents, data or information (e.g., national ID, international passport, bank statement, utility bill). For such purposes MoonPay reserves the right to collect User’s identification information for the AML/KYC Policy purposes.</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">MoonPay will take steps to confirm the authenticity of documents and information provided by the Users. All legal methods for double-checking identification information will be used and MoonPay reserves the right to investigate certain Users who have been determined to be risky or suspicious.</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">MoonPay reserves the right to verify User’s identity in an on-going basis, especially when their identification information has been changed or their activity seemed to be suspicious (unusual for the particular User). In addition, MoonPay reserves the right to request up-to-date documents from the Users, even though they have passed identity verification in the past.</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">User’s identification information will be collected, stored, shared and protected strictly in accordance with the MoonPay’s Privacy Policy and related regulations.</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">Once the User’s identity has been verified, MoonPay is able to remove itself from potential legal liability in a situation where its Services are used to conduct illegal activity.</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">MoonPay is prohibited from transacting with individuals, companies and countries that are on prescribed sanctions lists. MoonPay will therefore screen against United Nations, European Union, UK Treasury and US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions lists in all jurisdictions in which we operate.</p>

							<p class="question-contant__quest">Compliance Officer</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">The Compliance Officer is the person, duly authorized by MoonPay, whose duty is to ensure the effective implementation and enforcement of the AML/KYC Policy. It is the Compliance Officer’s responsibility to supervise all aspects of MoonPay’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, including but not limited to:</p>

							<ol class="question-ol">
								<li class="question-ol__item">Collecting Users’ identification information.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">Establishing and updating internal policies and procedures for the completion, review, submission and retention of all reports and records required under the applicable laws and regulations.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">Monitoring transactions and investigating any significant deviations from normal activity.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">Implementing a records management system for appropriate storage and retrieval of documents, files, forms and logs.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">Updating risk assessment regularly.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">Providing law enforcement with information as required under the applicable laws and regulations.</li>
							</ol>
							<p class="question-contant__text">The Compliance Officer is entitled to interact with law enforcement, which are involved in prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and other illegal activity.</p>

							<p class="question-contant__quest-sub">Monitoring transactions</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">The Users are known not only by verifying their identity (who they are) but, more importantly, by analyzing their transactional patterns (what they do). Therefore, MoonPay relies on data analysis as a risk-assessment and suspicion detection tool. MoonPay performs a variety of compliance-related tasks, including capturing data, filtering, record-keeping, investigation management, and reporting. System functionalities include:</p>

							<ol class="question-ol">
								<li class="question-ol__item">Daily check of Users against recognized “black lists” (e.g. OFAC), aggregating transfers by multiple data points, placing Users on watch and service denial lists, opening cases for investigation where needed, sending internal communications and filling out statutory reports, if applicable.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">Case and document management.</li>
							</ol>
							<p class="question-contant__text">With regard to the AML/KYC Policy, MoonPay will monitor all transactions and it reserves the right to:</p>

							<ol class="question-ol">
								<li class="question-ol__item">Ensure that transactions of suspicious nature are reported to the proper law enforcement through the Compliance Officer.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">Request the User to provide any additional information and documents in case of suspicious transactions.</li>
								<li class="question-ol__item">Suspend or terminate User’s Account when MoonPay has reasonably suspicion that such User engaged in illegal activity.</li>
							</ol>
							<p class="question-contant__text">The above list is not exhaustive and the Compliance Officer will monitor Users’ transactions on a day-to-day basis in order to define whether such transactions are to be reported and treated as suspicious or are to be treated as bona fide.</p>

							<p class="question-contant__quest-sub">Risk assessment</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">MoonPay, in line with the international requirements, has adopted a risk-based approach to combating money laundering and terrorist financing. By adopting a risk-based approach, MoonPay is able to ensure that measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing are commensurate to the identified risks. This will allow resources to be allocated in the most efficient ways. The principle is that resources should be directed in accordance with priorities so that the greatest risks receive the highest attention.</p>

							<p class="question-contant__quest">9. Terms of Use Modifications</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">FastEx may revise our Terms at any time and without notice to you or third parties. By using the Website, you agree to be bound by the then-current version of our Terms. We reserve the right to make any changes retroactive.</p>

							<p class="question-contant__quest">10. Governing Law & Arbitration</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">Our Terms are governed by the laws of Seychelles.These Terms are to be treated in all respects as a Seychelles contract.</p>

							<p class="question-contant__quest">11. Costs</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">From time to time, we may need to spend time dealing with issues brought to us by customers. Where any customer issue is not caused by our negligence or oversight, we reserve the right to recover reasonable administrative costs spent addressing the customer issue.</p>

							<p class="question-contant__quest">12. Privacy and Transparency Statement</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">FastEx respects the privacy of its Users by not requesting any information that is unnecessary for the use of the service or to comport with our obligations under applicable law. FastEx also does not in any way obscure the information that it does request or obtain. Due to the inherent transparency of blockchains, transactions to and from FastEx.io are public and easily correlated. Utilizing FastEx to obscure transactions or assets in any way is pointless and stupid. Law enforcement has full access to blockchain information that goes in or out of FastEx‘s system.</p>
							<p class="question-contant__text">You accept that FastEx will comply willingly with all legal requests for information from it. We reserve the right to provide information to law enforcement personnel and other third parties to answer inquiries; to respond to legal process; to respond to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction and those exercising the court’s authority; and, to protect FastEx and our users.</p>
